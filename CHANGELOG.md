### Future plans
-Versions 1.-.- will involve further color customizations, but the 2.0.0 update will add editor layout changes and optimizations. The aim is to create an enviroment that is as clean and efficient as possible. However, the 3.0.0 version update will be where the magic is. I have completely overwritten pretty much all vscode keybindings because most of them are unintuitive and confusing. Theres to many to remember and they are so easy to forget. So far I have implemented 110+ keybindings and they do all sorts of crazy neat things. However I will need more time for that update because I will need to implement my own code solutions to substitute for a few extensions some of the keybindings rely on. I also want more time because I am still changing keybindings semi-frequently and i them to be as intuitive and simple as possible.
